# Exploratory Data Analysis in R

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory data analysis is a statistical, approach towards analyzing data sets to investigate and summarize their main characteristics, often through statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

## Diagnostics
When importing data sets, it is important to consider characteristics about the data columns, rows, and individual cells.

### Variables
Name of each variable.

### Types

#### Numerical: Continuous
Measurable numbers that are fractional or decimal and cannot be counted (e.g., time, height, weight).

#### Numerical: Discrete
Countable whole numbers or integers (e.g., number of successes or failures).

#### Categorical: Nominal
Labeling variables without any order or quantitative value (e.g., hair color, nationality).

#### Categorical: Ordinal
Where there is a hierarchical order along a scale (e.g., ranks, letter grades, age groups).

### Missing Values
Cells, rows, or columns without data

Missing percent: percentage of missing values * Unique count: number of unique values.

Unique rate: rate of unique value - unique count / total number of observations.

## Summary Statistics
Summary statistics allow you to summarize large amounts of information about your data as quickly as possible.

### Central Tendency
Measuring a central property of your data. Some examples youâ€™ve probably heard of are:

Mean: Average value

Median: Middle value

Mode: Most common value

### Statistical Dispersion
Measure of data variability, scatter, or spread. Some examples you may have heard of:

Standard deviation (SD): The amount of variation that occurs in a set of values.

Interquartile range (IQR): The difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles

Outliers: A value outside of 1.5*IQR

### Distribution Shape
Measures of describing the shape of a distribution, usually compared to a normal distribution (bell-curve)

Skewness: The symmetry of the distribution

Kurtosis: The tailedness of the distribution

### Statistical Dependence (Correlation)
Measure of causality between two random variables (statistically). Notably, we approximate causality with correlations.
